# Active8POS
Design Examination

Requirements
- A shopping cart/checkout page for a web app (static page - i.e. not tied to any data)
- Designed with HTML/CSS
- Elements to think of: upsells, ad-ons, taxes, discounts, logged in user, etc (how is this displayed/shown)

Limitation
- Unable to make page responsive for mobile screens due to the time contstraint. But still designs were made with a mobile first approach

Design/Tech Stack
- Sketch
- HTML/CSS
- Jquery/Javascript
>Note: I decided not to use any CSS Frameworks for the projects so i can showcase then extent of my HTML/CSS experience

Enhancements
- Added my reinterpretation of Active8's branding(logo) and incorporated it in the designs
